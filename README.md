# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

# My Dev Portal

My Dev Portal is made with new developers in mind. It allows you to quickly and easily set up a public front facing portfolio to showcase your projects and skills. As well, you will be able to track and log your job applications.

Aside from functioning as a portfolio and a job hunt management tool for new developers My Dev Portal is also a great place to dive into the world of open source. As the public front facing portfolios rely on themes for their layout My Dev Portal allows for an unlimited number of new developers to add meaningful contributions, in the form of new themes, while putting a pull-request or two under their belt.

## Want to Contribute?

First, check out the code of conduct [here](https://github.com/SWLivingstone/my_dev_portal/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md).
Then, get crackin'!

As "My Dev Portal" is being built with new developers in mind it is also being built to allow for entry level contributions in the form of themes/templates.  One can never have too many themes!  Below you will find *very* detailed instructions on how to create a new Portfolio theme.  Do not let the long winded instructions fool you as adding a theme is quite simple!  The majority of the instructions are simply tables depicting the available user data.

**Designers Welcome**
If you have a great design for My Dev Portal that you would like made submit it as an issue with a mock-up and someone will build it!

The standards for contribution are simple and minimal.
* If what you have written is a function then please add an Rspec test for it (tests are not necessary for private/protected functions)
* Portfolio themes should be responsive (tests are not necessary for themes)
* Portfolio themes must support the available user preferences (listed below)
* If you are adding a larger feature please do your best to consider edge cases
* This is for fun and experiences so please have fun and learn!

If there is a feature that you would like to add then please send me a quick email at scottwlivingstone@gmail.com to tell me a little bit about it - I am more than happy to have additional features added.  As well, feel free to start working on the laundry list of features to be added which can be found listed under Projects.

Also, if you fancy yourself a CSS wizard and a master of style please feel free to update the look of any elements that you wish.

p.s. Pull requests to correct my spelling will also be accepted ;p

## Setting Up the Dev Environment

**Requirements:**
  * Rails 5.1.4
  * Ruby 2.3.5
  * Postgres
  * Bundler -v 1.15.2 (This is the version Heroku is currently using)

  1. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies
  2. Run `rails db:setup` to set up the Postgres database
  3. Run `rails server` to start the server at localhost:3000

## Adding a New Theme

  1. Create a new template file in 'app/views/front_end/portfolios/themes'
  * The file name will be the theme name
  * The file extension must be html.haml
    * If you don't already know Haml it will take you less than 20 minutes to learn and save you hours in the long run. http://haml.info/tutorial.html
  2. Create a new stylesheet in app/assets/stylesheets/themes
  * Give it the same name as your theme
  * The file extension must be .scss
  3.  Restart the server for the asset pipeline to pick up the new stylesheet and for the Themes initializer to pick up the template.

  The template is now selectable while logged into the My Dev Portal dashboard under the Portfolio Settings page.

  **IMPORTANT NOTES**

  * Name space your CSS by wrapping your entire theme in a div with the class name <your-theme>.  Then reference all calls in the CSS with that div.  This will prevent styles from overlapping between themes.
    ```
    // mytheme.html.haml

    .mytheme
      .header
      .body
        .content
      .footer

    // mytheme.scss

    .mytheme .header {
      style
    }

    .mytheme .body {
      style
    }
    ```

  * Please make your theme mobile friendly
  * You shouldn't need to add any dependencies.  Bootstrap 4, Sass, and jQuery are supported and with the fantastic addition of CSS grid you should be able to manage without adding further dependencies
  * Feel free to create reusable partials in app/views/portfolios/components.  As well, feel free to use any of the existing components that are in there.  You should be able to drop them straight into your theme with 
  `= render partial: 'portfolios/components/some_component'`
